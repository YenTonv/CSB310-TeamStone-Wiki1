## Team Stone Wiki 1 - Evolution of C++ Programming Language
1. Consider the 5 Ws and H: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How? - Christopher
Who created this programming language?
What is the programming language? Describe it?
Where is not super relevant, but you can add where it was created (Bell Labs?)
When was the programming language created?
Why was the programming language created? Was there a specific need?
How was this programming language created? What was the process of its evolution? What came before it? What came after it?

2. What are the programming language's primary advantages and disadvantages? Pick one other programming language that is different and compare it. - Yen Ton

3. What was the primary use case for the programming language? Software? Mobile? Mainframes? Mission-critical applications? - Riko

C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs around 1979 to be an extension of the C language that also had support for objects. This allowed for real-life analogies to be included in programming. In an interview with Stroustrup, when asked about his initial motivation behind designing C++, he stated, “I wanted to build a multi-computer system with a communication system that could be either shared memory or a network. My focus was on the software.” To do this, he needed to “write low-level, close-to-hardware code, such as memory managers, process schedulers, and device drivers”[1] and “separate software components so that they could be running on separate computers communicating in well-defined ways.”[1] Since there was no language that could do both, he decided to create his own.[1]
C++ or C with programming languages is a general-purpose language. It shows up just about everywhere, from gaming, GUI applications, web browsers, operating systems, to even the creation of other programming languages. It is also widely used in embedded systems because it is a mid-level language, which provides users with much more control over the system without having to deal with the complexity of lower-level languages.

4. Is the programming language currently being used still? If so, what is it being used for?  Is it legacy? - Riko

C++ is still in great demand and is nowhere near being a legacy language. It is still used for everything that it was used for. The reason C++ is still around when other languages come and go is largely because it does not belong to a corporation. C++ is almost completely compatible with C. C is a low-level language, while C++ is a mid-level language. This makes C++ being compatible with C very versatile, allowing people almost the same control that comes with low-level languages while keeping some features that belong to high-level languages.[1] C++ has also been constantly evolving, incorporating the most advanced and new computer techniques, which allows it to have a modern feel. Another fact that contributes to the popularity of C++ is that throughout all of its evolution, it always ensures to continue compatibility with its older versions.[1]

5. Speculate on what you think the future of this programming language is. Will it become obsolete? - Michael
