## Team Stone Wiki 1 - Evolution of C++ Programming Language
1. Consider the 5 Ws and H: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How? - Christopher
Who created this programming language?
What is the programming language? Describe it?
Where is not super relevant, but you can add where it was created (Bell Labs?)
When was the programming language created?
Why was the programming language created? Was there a specific need?
How was this programming language created? What was the process of its evolution? What came before it? What came after it?

2. What are the programming language's primary advantages and disadvantages? Pick one other programming language that is different and compare it. - Yen Ton

3. What was the primary use case for the programming language? Software? Mobile? Mainframes? Mission-critical applications? - Riko

C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs around 1979 to be an extension of the C language that also had support for objects. This allowed for real-life analogies to be included in programming. In an interview with Stroustrup, when asked about his initial motivation behind designing C++, he stated, “I wanted to build a multi-computer system with a communication system that could be either shared memory or a network. My focus was on the software.” To do this, he needed to “write low-level, close-to-hardware code, such as memory managers, process schedulers, and device drivers”[1] and “separate software components so that they could be running on separate computers communicating in well-defined ways.”[1] Since there was no language that could do both, he decided to create his own.[1]
C++ or C with programming languages is a general-purpose language. It shows up just about everywhere, from gaming, GUI applications, web browsers, operating systems, to even the creation of other programming languages. It is also widely used in embedded systems because it is a mid-level language, which provides users with much more control over the system without having to deal with the complexity of lower-level languages.

4. Is the programming language currently being used still? If so, what is it being used for?  Is it legacy? - Riko

C++ is still in great demand and is nowhere near being a legacy language. It is still used for everything that it was used for. The reason C++ is still around when other languages come and go is largely because it does not belong to a corporation. C++ is almost completely compatible with C. C is a low-level language, while C++ is a mid-level language. This makes C++ being compatible with C very versatile, allowing people almost the same control that comes with low-level languages while keeping some features that belong to high-level languages.[1] C++ has also been constantly evolving, incorporating the most advanced and new computer techniques, which allows it to have a modern feel. Another fact that contributes to the popularity of C++ is that throughout all of its evolution, it always ensures to continue compatibility with its older versions.[1]

5. Speculate on what you think the future of this programming language is. Will it become obsolete? - Michael

If we look at the robust history and current state of C++ we can speculate on its relevance and future. C++ has been in constant development for the past 40+ years and shows no sign of slowing down. When you navigate the organization’s official website (https://isocpp.org) you can find it full of very recent updates and links to future events. You can also find links to their their project on github, which  has regular updates and active contributors. The site also has a current status page that provides a timeline of major feature updates and a road map of currently planned updates leading into next year. This level of planning and messaging not only signals that C++ is still widely used but continuing to thrive despite new more accessible languages driving emergent technologies, such as A.I. When you search the internet for terms like “most popular programming languages” you will find an overwhelming number of blogs, academic articles and newsletters listing C++ as 'in demand'.  This is supported by popularity trends and tracking of github projects [madnight.github.io](images/language_popularity.png). C++ is in the top 5 and also gaining popularity. This is probably due to the aforementioned features but primarily the language's platform independence, backwards compatibility and level of control. With embedded systems getting smaller and more complex developers would want to fully harness their software and eek out as much performance as they can.  It’s unlikely that C++ will will become obsolete any time soon. It seems more likely that C++ will continue to evolve in the way it has for the last few decades by implementing new features and eventually adopting a new name.
